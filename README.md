# learn-pandas-ebook-notebooks
This repository contains the examples of the [Learning Pandas free eBook](https://riptutorial.com/ebook/pandas) as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. I started collecting the examples into notebooks with the hope this could be of great help to people who started learning [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).  
Disclaimer: I am not the author of the book nor its maintainer. I personally verified that the all of the examples are valid and then replicated them into Jupyter notebooks. Any feedback about the notebooks and contributions to this repo are welcomed. Please redirect any feedback about the book to [RIP Tutorial](https://riptutorial.com/).  
  
You need Python 3.x to execute these notebooks.  
So far only chapters from 1 to 5 have been covered. Stay tuned for updates.
